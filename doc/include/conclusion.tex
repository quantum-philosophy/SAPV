We proposed a novel framework for the analysis of process variation, which is based on indirect measurements and allows the manufactures for considerable reductions of the production costs. The technique was then exposed to an extensive study of various aspects concerning its practical implementations. The findings support the computational efficiency and high accuracy of our approach.
