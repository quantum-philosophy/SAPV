\subsection{Bayesian Inference} \slabel{bayesian-inference}
Let $\U$ be a set of parameters that are uncertain for us either in nature or due to our limited knowledge. The goal is to characterize the distribution of $\U$ given a data set the corresponding observations and some prior believes about $\U$. A natural solution is to rely on Bayes' rule \cite{gelman2004}:
\begin{equation} \elabel{bayes}
  \text{Prior} = \frac{\text{Likelihood} \times \text{Prior}}{\text{Evidence}}, \;\; \f{\u | \data} = \frac{\f{\data | \u} \f{\u}}{\f{\data}},
\end{equation}
where $\f{\cdot}$ and $\f{\cdot | \cdot}$ denote a probability density function and a conditional probability density function, respectively. $\f{\u}$ is known as the prior of the parameters $\U$, $\f{\u | \data}$ is the corresponding posterior, $\f{\data | \u}$ is the likelihood function, and $\f{\data}$ is a normalization constant.

For certain combinations of likelihood functions and prior densities, which usually appear in relatively simple problems, it is possible to obtain closed-form expressions for the corresponding posteriors; they can even fall into one of the standard families of probability distributions. However, it is rarely the case for challenging but typically more interesting problems. For instance, when modeling a physical process, the likelihood function can easily involve a system of differential equations, which is our scenario as we shall discuss in \sref{thermal-model}. In such a situation, in order to be able to draw samples from the posterior, one usually relies on sampling techniques. In this paper, we shall utilize MCMC sampling, namely the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \cite{gelman2004}.

\subsection{Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve Expansion} \slabel{kl-expansion}
Let $\H = \L{2}\probabilitySpace$ be the space of square-integrable functions defined on $\probabilitySpace$. $\H$ is a Hilbert space endowed the following (weighted) inner product and norm, for all $f, g \in \H: \outcomes \to \real$:
\begin{align*}
  & \iprod{f, g}_\H = \int_{\outcomes} f(\o) g(\o) \d\probabilityMeasure(\o) \;\;\; \text{and} \\
  & \norm{f}^2_\H = \iprod{f, f}_\H,
\end{align*}
respectively. Let $X: \outcomes \times \domain \to \real$ be a stochastic process in $\H$ defined over a bounded domain $\domain$. Let the covariance function $\fCov{\r, \r'} := \Cov{X(\r), X(\r')}$, $\r, \r' \in \domain$, of $X$ be continuous. Then, by Mercer's theorem, $\fCov{\r, \r'}$ admits the following decomposition \cite{maitre2010}:
\[
  \fCov{\r, \r'} = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \lambda_i \: \klb_i(\r) \: \klb_i(\r')
\]
where $\lambda_i \geq 0$ and $\klb_i(r)$ are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\fCov{\r, \r'}$, respectively. The latter are orthogonal:
\[
  \iprod{\klb_i, \klb_j}_\H = \delta_{ij}
\]
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta function. The eigenpairs are found by solving
\begin{equation} \elabel{kl-eigenpairs}
  \int_\domain \fCov{\r, \r'} \: \klb_i (\r) \: \d\r = \lambda_i \: \klb_i(\r').
\end{equation}
The stochastic process $X$ can then be expanded into the following Fourier-like series:
\begin{equation} \elabel{kl-expansion}
  X(\r) = \E{X(\r)} + \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \sqrt{\lambda_i} \: \klb_i(\r) \: \Z_i
\end{equation}
where $\E{\cdot}$ denotes the mathematical expectation, and $\Z_i$ are uncorrelated \rvs. When $X$ is Gaussian, $\Z_i$ are independent standard Gaussian \rvs. For practical computations, \eref{kl-expansion} is truncated; the most common strategy to do so is to monitor the decay of the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ and to find the smallest $n$ such that $\lambda_n / \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i$ is below a predefined threshold.

\subsection{Polynomial Chaos} \slabel{pc-expansion}
Let $f: \vZ \mapsto f(\vZ)$ be a real-valued function in $\H$ of $n$ independent standard Gaussian \rvs\ $\vZ = (\Z_i): \outcomes \to \real^n$. Then $f$ admits the following expansion convergent in the mean-square sense \cite{maitre2010}:
\begin{equation} \elabel{pc-expansion}
  f(\vZ) = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \iprod{f, \vpcb_i}_\H \vpcb_i(\vZ)
\end{equation}
where $\{ \vpcb_i \}_{i = 0}^\infty$ is a basis composed of $n$-variate polynomials orthogonal with respect to the distribution of $\vZ$, that is,
\[
  \iprod{\vpcb_i, \vpcb_j}_\H = \norm{\vpcb_i}^2_\H \delta_{ij}.
\]
Each polynomial $\vpcb_i$ is a product of $n$ (univariate) Hermite polynomials $\pcb_i$: $\vpcb_i(\vZ) = \prod_{j = 1}^n \pcb_{i_j}(\Z_j)$. To make \eref{pc-expansion} tractable for computations, the expansion is truncated. A common strategy to perform such a truncation is to keep polynomials up to some predefined total order $\norder$; in this case, the total number of expansion terms $\nterms$ is
\[
  \nterms = {n + \norder \choose n} - 1.
\]
