We proposed a framework for the analysis of process variation across semiconductor wafers based on cost-efficient, indirect measurements.
The technique was exposed to an extensive study of various aspects concerning its implementation.
The obtained results support the computational efficiency and accuracy of our approach.

We would like to note that, although the framework was demonstrated on the effective channel length and temperature, it can be readily utilized to analyze any other \qois\ based on any other \qoms.
