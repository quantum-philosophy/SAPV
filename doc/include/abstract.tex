In this paper, we develop a non-intrusive, computationally efficient framework for characterization of process variation of multiprocessor systems. Instead of direct measurements of quantities of interest, such as the effective channel length, gate oxide thickness, threshold voltage, \etc, the framework operates solely on temperature measurements corresponding to arbitrary dynamic power profiles serving as test patterns.
