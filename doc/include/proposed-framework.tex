In this section, we present our temperature-based technique for the characterization of process variation. The structure of the framework is divided into four major stages depicted in \fref{algorithm}. Stage~1 is the data-harvesting stage wherein the user is supposed to collect a set of observations $\Data$ as described in \sref{motivation}. At Stage~2, we undertake an auxiliary procedure that delivers an optimized proposal distribution for the MCMC sampling stage, Stage~3. Stage~3 produces a collection of samples of the \qoi, such as the effective channel length, which is then processed at Stage~4 in order to estimate various characteristics, specified by the user, of this \qoi, \eg, to compute the probability of the effective channel length to be smaller than a certain threshold as motivated in \sref{motivation}. As shown in \fref{algorithm}, Stages 2 and 3 actively communicate with two models, call the forward and statistical models, which we shall start our presentation from in the following subsections.
