Let $\pspace$ be a probability space where $\outcomes$ is a set of outcomes, $\salgebra \subseteq 2^\outcomes$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\outcomes$, and $\pmeasure: \salgebra \to [0, 1]$ is a probability measure \cite{durrett2010}. Loosely speaking, an $n$-dimensional \rv\ is then a mapping $X: \outcomes \to \real^n$. In what follows, the probability space $\pspace$ is always implied.

Consider a heterogeneous multiprocessor system that consists of $\ncores$ processing elements and is equipped with a thermal package. The processing elements are the active components of the system identified at the intended level of granularity (processors, ALUs, caches, registers, \etc).

Let $\specification$ be a thermal specification of the system defined as a set of temperature-related information: (a) the floorplans of the active layers of the chip; (b) the geometry of the thermal package; (c) the thermal parameters of the materials that the chip and package are made of. In addition, the system depends on a set of uncertain parameters, denoted by a random vector $\vU$, which manifest themselves in deviations of the actual power dissipation from nominal values and, consequently, in deviations of temperature from the one corresponding to the nominal power consumption.

A power profile $\profileP$ over a time interval $\period$ is a tuple composed of a time partition $\partition = \{ 0 = \t_0 < \dotsc < \t_{\nsteps} = \period \}$ with $\nsteps$ subintervals $\{ \dt_i = \t_i - \t_{i - 1} \}_{i = 1}^{\nsteps}$ and a data matrix $\mP = \left(\vP_1, \dotsc, \vP_{\nsteps} \right) \in \real^{\ncores \times \nsteps}$ that captures the power dissipation of all $\ncores$ processing elements at the beginning of all $\nsteps$ time intervals. A temperature profile $\profileT$ has the same definition as for power except that the data matrix $\mT = \left( \vT_1, \dots, \vT_{\nsteps} \right) \in \real^{\ncores \times \nsteps}$ tracks temperature. Finally, denote a measurement-based data set of $\ndata$ temperature profiles by $\data = \{ (\partition, \mT^{(i)}_\meas) \}_{i = 1}^{\ndata}$.

The goal of this work is to develop an UQ framework for characterization of the uncertain parameters $\vU$ impacting a multiprocessor platform by analyzing temperature samples collected at different instantiations of the platform, \eg, at different dies on a wafer. The input to the framework should be composed of (a) a thermal specification $\specification$ of the platform; (b) a data set of temperature measurements $\data$; (c) the dynamic power profile $\profilePdyn$ used to obtain $\data$; and, optionally, (d) a prior knowledge on the distribution of the uncertain parameters $\vU$. Taking into account both the prior knowledge and observed data, the framework should deliver an estimate of the probability distribution of the uncertain parameters with the desired level of accuracy and at low computational costs.
