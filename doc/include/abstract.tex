In this paper, we propose and develop a novel technique for the identification of process variations distributed across the wafers that are used for the fabrication of multiprocessor systems. Instead of taking direct measurements of the quantity of interest being characterized, our technique operates on indirect observations, namely, on temperature profiles, which are cheap to collect as no deployment of expensive test structures is required.
The experimental results provide a comprehensive study of our approach for a wide range of configurations having high practical importance.
