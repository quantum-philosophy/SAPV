In this paper, we present a novel framework for the analysis of process variations across semiconductor wafers. Instead of taking direct measurements of the quantity of interest being characterized, such as the channel length, our technique operates on indirect observations, namely, on temperature, which are cheap to collect as no deployment of expensive test structures or equipments on the wafer is required.
The experimental results provide a comprehensive study of our approach for a wide range of configurations having high practical importance.
