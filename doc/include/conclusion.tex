We proposed a novel framework for the analysis of process variation, which is based on indirect measurements and allows the manufactures for considerable reductions of the production costs. The technique was then exposed to an extensive study of various aspects concerning its practical implementations. The findings support the computational efficiency and high accuracy of our approach.

As a closing remark, we would like to note that, although the framework was demonstrated on the effective channel length, it can be readily utilized to analyze any other \qois\ affected by process variation and, moreover, to study their combinations. In addition, the user is free to replace the forward model in \fref{algorithm}, consisting of the power and temperature components, with another model, serving the same purpose, which can be more beneficial in a particular context, \eg, a deliberately chosen ad hoc model is expected to increase the performance of our framework even higher.
