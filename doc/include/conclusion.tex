In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for the analysis of process variation across semiconductor wafers, which is based on cost-efficient indirect measurements analyzed via Bayesian inference.
The technique was exposed to an extensive study of various aspects concerning its practical implementation.
The obtained findings support the computational efficiency and accuracy of our approach.

As a closing remark, we would like to note that, although the framework was demonstrated on the effective channel length, it can be readily utilized to analyze any other \qois\ affected by process variation and, moreover, to study their combinations.
In addition, the user is free to replace the data model described in \sref{data-model}, which consists of the power and temperature components, with another model, serving the same purpose, if this change is considered to be more beneficial in a certain particular context.
