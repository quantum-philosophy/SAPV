In this paper, we develop a non-intrusive, computationally efficient framework for characterization of process variations of multiprocessor systems. Instead of direct measurements of quantities of interest (\eg, the effective channel length, gate oxide thickness, threshold voltage, \etc), the framework operates solely on temperature measurements (\eg, from IR cameras) corresponding to arbitrary test dynamic power profiles.
