We focus on the major cause of uncertainty of the leakage current: the effective channel length. In \eref{mu-u-prior}, $\mu_0 = 45~\text{nm}$ and $\sigma_0 = 1~\text{nm}$. In \eref{sigma2-u-prior} and \eref{sigma2-noise-prior}, $\nu_\noise = \nu_\u = 2$ and $\tau^2_\noise = \tau^2_\u = 1$, which results in a heavy-tailed distribution allowing one for having a rather limited prior knowledge.
