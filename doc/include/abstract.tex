In this paper, we propose and develop a novel multiprocessor system design framework for the analysis of process variations across semiconductor wafers. Instead of taking direct measurements of the quantity of interest being characterized, our technique operates on indirect observations, namely, on temperature profiles, which are cheap to collect as no deployment of expensive test structures is required.
The experimental results provide a comprehensive study of our approach for a wide range of configurations having high practical importance.
