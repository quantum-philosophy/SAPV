We present a framework for the analysis of process variation across semiconductor wafers.
The framework is able to quantify not only the secondary parameters affected by process variation, such as the leakage current, but also the primary ones, such as the effective channel length.
Instead of taking direct measurements of the quantity of interest, our technique employs Bayesian inference to draw conclusions based on indirect observations, namely, on temperature.
Such observations are cheap to collect as no deployment of expensive test structures or equipments on the wafer is required.
The experimental results contain an assessment of our approach for a wide range of configurations.
