The framework is based on Bayesian inference.

Bayesian inference is utilized in \cite{zhang2010} to identify an optimal set of locations on the wafer wherein measurements should be taken in order to quantify the uncertainties due to the manufacturing process with the maximal accuracy. In \cite{paek2012}, the authors address the inference of the power dissipation based on transient temperature profiles using Markov random fields. A temperature-based characretization of the parameters affecting power is also considered in \cite{mesa-martinez2007} wherein a genetic algorithm is employed for model fitting.
