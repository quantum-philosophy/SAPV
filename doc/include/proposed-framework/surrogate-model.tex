The straightforward MCMC sampling is highly time-consuming. This is mainly due to the repetitive solution of the thermal system given in \eref{thermal-system}. Therefore, a natural way to speed up the computational process is to bypass \eref{thermal-system}. To this end, using the Gaussian process (GP) regression introduced in \sref{gp-regression}, the forward model is approximated as
\begin{equation} \elabel{gp-approximation}
  \mvT = \model{\vparam}
\end{equation}
Once the representation in \eref{gp-approximation} has been constructed, the evaluation of the forward model becomes trivial.
