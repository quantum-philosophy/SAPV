\subsection{Bayesian Inference}
Let $\vU$ be a set of parameters that are uncertain for us either in nature or due to our limited knowledge. The goal is to characterize the distribution of $\vU$ given a data set the corresponding observations and some prior believes about $\vU$. A natural solution is to rely on Bayes' rule \cite{gelman2004}:
\begin{equation} \elabel{bayes}
  \f{\u | \data} = \frac{\f{\data | \u} \f{\u}}{\f{\data}}
\end{equation}
where $\f{\cdot}$ and $\f{\cdot | \cdot}$ denote a probability density function (\pdf) and a conditional \pdf\ \cite{durrett2010}, respectively. $\f{\u}$ is known as the prior distribution of the parameters $\vU$, $\f{\u | \data}$ is the corresponding posterior distribution, $\f{\data | \u}$ is the likelihood function, and $\f{\data}$ is a normalization constant.

\subsection{Polynomial Chaos}
For clarity, the construction below is given for the one-dimensional case. The extension, based on tensor products, to multiple dimensions is immediate; see, \eg, \cite{maitre2010}.

Let $\Z: \outcomes \to \real$ be a standard Gaussian \rv\ and denote $\gpmeasure$ and $\f{\Z}{\z}$ the distribution and density of $\Z$, respectively. $\Z$ induces the measure $\gpmeasure$ on the Borel space $\bspace$ leading to the probability space $\gpspace$. $\gpspace$ is a Hilbert space wherein the associated inner product and norm are defined as
\begin{align}
  & \iprod{f}{g} = \E{f(\Z) g(\Z)} = \int_\real f(\z) g(\z) \f{\Z}{\z} \d\z, \elabel{inner-product} \\
  & \norm{f}^2 = \iprod{f, f} \nonumber,
\end{align}
respectively, where $\E{\cdot}$ stands for the mathematical expectation. Let $\lg = \lgpspace$ be the space of square-integrable \rvs\ defined on $\gpspace$. Any $f \in \lg$ admits the following expansion convergent in the space $\lg$ \cite{maitre2010}:
\[
  f(\Z) = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \iprod{f}{\pcb_i} \pcb_i(\Z)
\]
where $\{ \pcb_i \}_{i = 0}^\infty$ is the basis composed of Hermite polynomials. The polynomials are orthogonal with respect to $\gpmeasure$, that is,
\[
  \iprod{\pcb_i}{\pcb_j} = \norm{\pcb_i}^2 \delta_{ij} = i! \: \delta_{ij}
\]
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta function.

In $n$ dimensions, the inner product in \eref{inner-product} is an $n$-dimensional integral, and the basis functionals are products of $n$ Hermite polynomials; see, \eg, \cite{maitre2010}. We shall keep the notation above for the multidimensional case as well.
