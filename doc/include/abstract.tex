In this paper, we present a novel framework for the analysis of process variation across semiconductor wafers.
The proposed framework is able to characterize the primary sources of uncertainty such as the effective channel length.
Moreover, instead of taking direct measurements of the quantity of interest being characterized, our technique employs Bayesian inference to draw conclusions based on indirect observations, namely, on temperature.
Such observations are cheap to collect as no deployment of expensive test structures or equipments on the wafer is required.
The experimental results provide a comprehensive study of our approach for a wide range of configurations.
