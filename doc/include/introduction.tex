Process variation is one of the major concerns of multiprocessor system architects. The crucial implication of process variation is that it renders the key parameters of a technological process, \eg, the effective channel length, gate oxide thickness, threshold voltage, \etc, as random variables (\rvs). Hence, a deterministic workload of the multiprocessor platform at hand results in stochastic power and, consequently, temperature profiles as they essentially depend on those key parameters; in other words, power and temperature of two ``identical'' dies, performing the same operation, vary. This phenomenon leads to performance degradation and, in the worst case, to burnt chips. Therefore, the concept of uncertainty quantification (UQ) has become central for the multiprocessor system design workflows that are concerned with efficiency and robustness of their products. In this paper, we consider an inverse UQ problem targeted at inferring the parameters that are deteriorated by process variation based on a data set of measurements, which we analyze using Bayesian inference \cite{gelman2004}.

Bayesian inference is utilized in \cite{zhang2010} to identify an optimal set of spatial locations on the wafer, in which the quantity of interest (QoI), such as the effective channel length, should be measured in order to characterize it with the maximal accuracy. In \cite{paek2012}, the authors address the inference of the power dissipation based on transient temperature profiles using Markov random fields. Another temperature-based characterization of power is developed in \cite{mesa-martinez2007} wherein a genetic algorithm is employed for reconstruction of the power model. It should be noted that the approach in \cite{zhang2010} requires measurement structures to be deployed onto each die on the wafer as it operates on direct observations of the QoI. This can be expensive and, thus, impractical to undertake. The techniques in \cite{paek2012} and \cite{mesa-martinez2007} solely focus on power and do attempt to infer other parameters.

The contribution of our work is in the following. We propose a novel approach to UQ of process variation based on indirect, incomplete, and noisy measurements. Indirectness is the key ingredient of our technique: instead of measuring the QoI directly, we propose to measure temperature.

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. In \sref{problem-formulation}, we formulate the objective of our study. Preliminary materials are given in \sref{preliminaries}. The proposed UQ framework is presented in \sref{proposed-framework}. Experimental results are reported in \sref{experimental-results}. \sref{conclusion} concludes the paper.
