We focus on the major cause of uncertainty due to the leakage current: the effective channel length. It is relatively straightforward to specify $\mu_0$ and $\sigma^2_0$ of $\mu_\u$ as such information is usually available. The parameters $\nu_\u$ and $\nu_\noise$, representing the degree of beliefs, and $\tau^2_\u$ and $\tau^2_\u$, representing the presumable values of $\sigma^2_\u$ and $\sigma^2_\noise$, should be set according to the prior knowledge. In the absence of such knowledge, a non-informative prior can be chosen for $\sigma^2_\u$ and $\sigma^2_\noise$ \cite{gelman2004}.
% In \eref{mu-u-prior}, $\mu_0 = 45~\text{nm}$ and $\sigma_0 = 1~\text{nm}$. In \eref{sigma2-u-prior} and \eref{sigma2-noise-prior}, $\nu_\noise = \nu_\u = 2$ and $\tau^2_\noise = \tau^2_\u = 1$, which results in a heavy-tailed distribution allowing one for having a rather limited prior knowledge.
